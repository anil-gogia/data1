= Lab 11 - Build a Quotes services using MongoDB

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes


[abstract]
--
In this lab we'll begin the first subproject of our complete cloud-native application architecture: _SpringTrader_, which implements the quotes fetching portion of a ``Trading-like'' application.
This microservice will provide the _Quotes Service_, which will allow us to search for companies and symbols in order to make transactions.

We'll be using the http://dev.markitondemand.com[MarketItOnDemad] API, and we'll model its `Quote and Company as a Stock` concept in this microservice.
--

NOTE: The completed code for this lab can be found at `$COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_05/lab_11/springtrader-quotes`.


== Exploring springtrader-quotes

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_05/lab_11/springtrader-quotes/initial
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.


. Explore the new `quotes` microservice:
- How many domain classes do you now have?
- How many controller classes?
+
You can see that `html`, `css` and `javascript` files are not included in `springtrader-quotes`. They will all be contained in a `web` microservice (dedicated to the web layer)


. Run the application using an embedded version of MongoDB
. Access the application at http://localhost:8086/quote/msft

+
You should see the below:

[source,json]

{"Symbol":"MSFT","Name":"Microsoft Corp","Exchange":"NASDAQ","Status":"SUCCESS","LastPrice":53.95,

== Preparing for Cloud Foundry

. We want to bind to a MongoDB data source when running on Cloud Foundry, so let's create one:
+
----
$ cf cs p-mongodb development springtrader-quotes-db
Creating service springtrader-quotes-db in org cqueiroz-pivot / space development as cqueiroz@pivotal.io...
OK
----

NOTE: if you are using Pivotal Web Service, the above service is not available in the command line. You just need to create it using the Web console at https://console.run.pivotal.io. You can select a MongoDB  service and name it `springtrader-quotes-db`.

. Go into the package `io.pivotal.sprintrader.quotes.config` and observe the differences between `MongoCloudConfig` (`cloud` profile) and `MongoLocalConfig` (`local` profile)
+
As you will see, the `local` profile provides you with a MongoDB in-memory database. The `cloud` profile will rely on the service that you have just created on Cloud Foundry.

. Open `src/main/resources/application.yml` and see that a `cloud` profile has been setup in preparation for deployment to Cloud Foundry:
+
----
...
---
spring:
  profiles: cloud
---
...
----

. Rebuild the JAR:
+
----
$ mvn clean package
----

== Deploying to Cloud Foundry

. Create an application manifest in `manifest.yml`:
+
[source,yml]
----
timeout: 180
instances: 1
memory: 512M
env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
applications:
- name: quotes
  random-route: true
  path: target/lab11-quotes-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services: [ springtrader-quotes-db ]
----

. Push to Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf push

...

. Access the application at the random route provided by CF (such as `http://quotes-undespising-lenition.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io/quote/aapl`). The output should look like:
