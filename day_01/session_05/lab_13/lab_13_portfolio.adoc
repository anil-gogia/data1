= Lab 13 - Build a Portfolio with MySQL

Estimated time to complete: 30 minutes
[abstract]
--
In this lab we'll begin the third subproject of our complete cloud-native application architecture: _SpringTrader_, which implements the quotes fetching portion of a ``Trading-like'' application.
This microservice will provide the _Portfolio Service_, which will allow us to see our trading transactions and assets.

--

NOTE: The completed code for this lab can be found at `$COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_05/lab_13/complete/springtrader-portfolio`.

== Exploring springtrader-portfolio

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_05/lab_13/initial/springtrader-portfolio
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.

. Explore the new `portfolio` microservice:
- How many domain classes do you now have? Look are the relationship between `Portfolio`, `Holder`, `Order`
- Open the class `PortfolioService`. See how it relies on the `quotes` and `accounts` microservices. As a consequence, the `portfolio` microservice won't work if the 2 other ones are not up and running.


. Add the following to `application.yml`. As you can see, each of our microservices runs on a different port so they can all run on your local computer.
+
----
spring:
  profiles.active: local
  application:
     name: portfolio

---
spring:
  profiles: local

server:
  port: 8088

quotes:
  url: http://localhost:8086

accounts:
  url: http://localhost:8082

---
spring:
  profiles: cloud
quotes:
  url: http://quotes-undespising-lenition.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io

accounts:
  url: http://accounts-recompensatory-assassinator.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io
----

. Open `src/main/resources/import.sql`. As seen before, Spring Boot automatically loads this file at startup time. You will therefore have one order created at application startup time.

. To run the application locally you have to add H2 dependency to your `pom.xml` file.

+
----
 <dependency>
	<groupId>com.h2database</groupId>
  	<artifactId>h2</artifactId>
    <scope>runtime</scope>
 </dependency>
----

. Make sure the `accounts` and `quotes` microservices are still running

. Run the application and open the url http://localhost:8088/portfolio/johnsmith into your web browser. You should see the following:
+
----
{"accountId":null,"name":null,"currentTotalValue":255.4500000000000170530256582424044609069824218750,
"purchaseValue":100.00,"sellValue":0,"holdings":{"EMC":{"id":null,"symbol":"EMC","quantity":10,
"purchaseValue":100.00,"sellValue":0,"orders":[{"orderId":1,"accountId":"johndoe","symbol":"EMC",
"orderFee":1.00,"completionDate":1329759342904,"orderType":"BUY","price":10.00,"quantity":10}],
"currentValue":25.5450000000000017053025658242404460906982421875}}}

== Preparing for Cloud Foundry


. We want to bind to a MongoDB data source when running on Cloud Foundry, so let's create one:
+
----
$ cf cs p-mysql 100mb-dev springtrader-portfolio-db
Creating service instance springtrader-portfolio-db in org pivot-cqueiroz / space development as cqueiroz@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Add the appropriate dependencies for the Spring Cloud Connectors:
+
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
  <artifactId>spring-cloud-spring-service-connector</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. Build the JAR:
+
----
$ mvn clean package
----

== Deploying to Cloud Foundry

. Create an application manifest in `manifest.yml`:
+
[source,yml]
----
timeout: 180
instances: 1
memory: 512M
env:
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud
    JAVA_OPTS: -Djava.security.egd=file:///dev/urandom
applications:
- name: portfolio
  random-route: true
  path: target/lab13-portfolio-1.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar
  services: [ springtrader-portfolio-db ]
----
. Before push to Cloud Foundry adjuste the application.yml (cloud profile) file with the URLs for the Accounts and Quotes services. Something like:
+
----
spring:
  profiles: cloud
  jpa:
     hibernate:
        ddl-auto: update

quotes:
  url: http://quotes-undespising-lenition.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io

accounts:
  url: http://accounts-recompensatory-assassinator.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io
----

. Push to Cloud Foundry:
+
----
$ cf push

...

----

. Run the load script with the `ROUTE` environment variable set to the random route generated by CF to insert data via the application's API:
+
----
$ ROUTE=portfolio.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io  loadAccounts.sh
$ ROUTE=portfolio.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io  loadOrders.sh
----

. Access the application using `curl` to make sure everything is working properly:
+
----
$ curl -i portfolio.cfapps.pez.pivotal.io/portfolio/johndoe
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: Apache-Coyote/1.1
